# Exploring customer behavior and the impact of product reviews on Amazon marketplace.

# Abstract

Started 20 years ago, Amazon completely reshaped the online market.
Amazon has more than half a billion different products within very diversified categories (book, kitchen equipment, jewelry..).

This growth had an impact on how people sell and buy on the platform.
Customer reviews have a crucial importance on the choices customer make before buying a product.

Our goal is to get valuable insights of the Amazon landscape `todo`

# Research questions
We will consider the following questions and address them within our project:
- Is there an impact of a customer review on the product success, depending on its content?
- What is the impact of the first customer review?
- Can we distinguish categories of customers in term of interest and activity on amazon?
- Within specific categories (e.g. Books), can we find trends?
- What is the success distribution among products within all the categories?
